Reviewer 1: 
Overall your code looks like it runs well. Good work on making the app run on both platforms,handheld and tablet. 
I also think that you could add all your text in one block and then you wouldn't run into potential errors later,
it would clean everything up. Nice work on making sure your text was a still a readable size. Very well done!
